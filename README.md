Welcome to the Peptide Toxicity Prediction Website
This technical framework is developed for toxic peptide prediction and integrates embeddings from the ESM2-t33 and ProtT5 protein large language models.<br>
A two-stage strategy is employed to extract and select key features, and a CNN+ResNet–based classification model is used to construct the core prediction system.<br>
The final model is integrated into this platform to support the design and prediction of toxic peptides.
